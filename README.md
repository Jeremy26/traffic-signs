This README file will explain how to understand the project. On the GitHub repositery you're in, you can see multiple directories and files:

Traffic_Signs_classifier.html or .ipynb are my code files in two formats. You can use either one of them.
signnames.csv contain a CSV file with each traffic sign code (for example 1) and its signification (for example "20km/h limitation). The dataset contains 43 possible outputs.
That's it ! I did not include the dataset because it is way too heavy and the correctors of this project have it already. Just know that you can download it on : https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/5898cd6f_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip

Concerning the README, You're reading it! and here is a link to my project (https://github.com/Jeremy26/traffic-signs/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)
